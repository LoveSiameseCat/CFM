# CFM

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315169

------
This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation for CFM. Note that we currently only released the model and pre-trained model since it is easy to evaluate on your customized dataset. Please forgive the irregular variable naming in the code, it is too busy for me to re-organize the source code T.T.

## Requirements
- timm == 0.5.4
- pytorch == 1.8.0

## Pre-trained model preperation
The pretrained models can be access here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iP8k4ffJ-3WcuEg5uyrsY3qOY0ALi83H/view?usp=sharing
